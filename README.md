Project Desciption: This project is integration of two part. One is the judging part and another is the server connection part. We have done the server task with socket programming of JAVA. For compiling and judging we used 'cmd' invoking from java program. The source codes submitted to server are stored in a certain path. Then from that location the code are executed and judged with the correct ans which are also set at certain(Desktop) location. The main two class to be run is login(for contestant) and start(for host). When a user/contestant submit's a code and it got accepted, it is added into the standings with the associated penalty. Thus the contest is constructed.

The judge/host can creat new user before a contest. He can see the current standings, status. He can terminate the contest anytime he want.
