Project Desciption: This project is integration of two part. One is the judging part and another is the server connection part. We have done the server task with socket programming of JAVA. For compiling and judging we took the help of windows CMD, invoking it from our java program. When the source codes are being submitted to the server, they got stored in a defined path. Then, from that location the codes are executed and evaluated with the correct answer files which are also present at certain location. The main two classes are: login(for contestant) and start(for host). When a user/contestant submits a code and it comes accepted, it is added into the standings with the associated penalty score. Thus the contest is constructed.

The judge/host can create new users before a contest. He can see the current standings, status and can also terminate the contest anytime he want.
